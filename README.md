# MandelPenguin

MandelPenguin is a very rough implementation of a program that draws the Mandelbrot set using the HTML5 canvas and Web Workers.
Its purpose is to illustrate the difference in performance and perceived performance when using one thread vs using multiple threads.

This is not a sophisticated renderer.
This is not necessarily a fast renderer.

I will, however, be polishing this and adding new features in the future.
